# Dog Cat Classifier
This project is a dog and cat classifier that uses deep learning techniques to distinguish between images of dogs and cats. It is built using TensorFlow and trained on a large dataset of dog and cat images.

#### Installation
- Clone the repository:
  - git clone https://github.com/Samargithubb/CNNClassifier.git
  
- Install the required dependencies:

  - pip install -r requirements.txt
  
#### Usage
- Run python app.py in the terminal or directly click on Run from the code editor.
- Click on the Upload button and upload the image
- After clicking on predict button 
- Result will be displayed on UI

  
#### Model and Training
The classifier model used in this project is **VGG16** based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. It has been trained on a dataset of labeled dog and cat images to learn the distinguishing features of each class. The training process involved
- Data Ingestion
- Base Model creation
- Model Training
- Model Evaluation

#### Results
The classifier achieves an accuracy of ["loss": 11.801721572875977, 
"accuracy": 0.9830508232116699] on the test dataset. It performs well in distinguishing between images of dogs and cats, but like any machine learning model, it may occasionally make mistakes.
